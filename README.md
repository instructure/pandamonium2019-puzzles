Pandamonium 2019 Puzzle Hunt
============================

The puzzle hunt at Pandamonium 2019 took players on a trip around the frontier in search of Pando's lost treasure. While the event itself is long over, you can recreate the puzzle part of it for yourself with these included PDF files. Here's how it works:

Puzzles.pdf contains eight pages, one for each of the puzzles in the event, plus the Intro sheet to provide some backstory. Print this out; most of these are designed to be written on and filled out. Each puzzle here, when you solve it, will give you a word or phrase.

In the real-life event, you'd fill those out in the blanks in the Intro and come see the sheriff for a corresponding map piece for each one you get right, but here those map pieces are all inside the "Map" folder, each one in its own ZIP file. These files are password-protected, each password being the answer to the puzzle of the same name written in _all lowercase_. For example, if the puzzle called "The Saloon" had an answer of "Monument Valley", you would unzip "Saloon.zip" with a password of `monument valley`. The Escape Room piece you get for free now, since there's no good way to simulate that in a PDF file.

There's no prize for solving the final puzzle any more, but at least you'll know where the treasure was buried.
